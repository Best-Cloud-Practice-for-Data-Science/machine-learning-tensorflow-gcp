# Intro to TensorFlow

## Introduction
The tool we will use to write machine learning programs is TensorFlow and so in this course, we will introduce you to TensorFlow. In the first course, you learned how to formulate business problems as machine learning problems and in the second course, you learned how machine works in practice and how to create datasets that you can use for machine learning. Now that you have the data in place, you are ready to get started writing machine learning programs.
## Learning Objectives
- Create machine learning models in TensorFlow
- Use the TensorFlow libraries to solve numerical problems
- Troubleshoot and debug common TensorFlow code pitfalls
- Use tf_estimator to create, train, and evaluate an ML model
- Train, deploy, and productionalize ML models at scale with Cloud Machine Learning Engine
## Syllabus
- Module 1: Core TensorFlow
- Module 2 - Estimator API
- Module 3: Scaling TensorFlow models with CMLE
